# 🚀 Quick start

1. **Get a copy on your machine**

- Getting Started with Gatsby

To use Gatsby.js, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Gatsby starters can be installed via the Gatsby CLI tool or by cloning a GitHub repository. Let's explore the CLI tool by first installing it.

```shell
# Install the Gatsby CLI tool globally on your machine
$ npm install --global gatsby-cli
```

```shell
# create a new Gatsby Website
gatsby new website https://github.com/yezz123/yezz.me/
```

2. **Start developing.**

Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.

```shell
cd website
gatsby develop
```

3. **Open the source code and start editing!**

   Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

   _Note: You'll also see a second link:_`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

   Open the `my-site` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

## 🧐 What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.

```shell
$ tree
    .
    ├── node_modules
    ├── src
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── .eslintrc.js
    ├── .prettierignore
    ├── .prettierrc
    ├── gatsby-browser.js
    ├── gatsby-config.js
    ├── package-lock.json
    └── package.json
```
